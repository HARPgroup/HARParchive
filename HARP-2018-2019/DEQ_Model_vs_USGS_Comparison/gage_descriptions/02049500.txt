This river segment follows part of the flow of the Blackwater River, a tributary of the Meherrin River. The gage is located in Southampton County, VA (Lat 36°45'45", Long 76°53'55") approximately 17 miles west of Suffolk, VA. Drainage area is 613 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1944 and is still taking data. Water is diverted from this area to the City of Norfolk by a pumping station upstream of the gage. It is also believed that in extreme low flow conditions, water can be lost to storage, especially between Zuni and Franklin.
