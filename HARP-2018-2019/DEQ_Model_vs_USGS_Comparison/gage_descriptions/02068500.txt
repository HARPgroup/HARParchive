This river segment follows part of the flow of the Dan River. The gage is located in Stokes County, NC (Lat 36°30'54", Long 80°18'11") approximately 26 miles southwest of Martinsville, VA. Drainage area is 129 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1924 and is still taking data but there is a gap from 1987-10-13 to 1991-11-30. The Talbot and Townes reservoirs are located above the Pinnacles Hydroelectric Plant in Virginia 28 miles above the station. There are also several gristmills but they are not expected to affect the flow.
