This river segment follows part of the flow of the Smith River, a tributary of the Dan River. The gage is located in Henry County, VA (Lat 36°39'40", Long 79°52'51") approximately 2 miles south of Martinsville, VA. Drainage area is 379 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1929 and is still taking data. The flow of this area has been regulated since August of 1950 by the Philpott Lake, approximately 20 miles upstream. Additional regulations have since been put in place since the addition of a power plant 1,000 ft upstream.
