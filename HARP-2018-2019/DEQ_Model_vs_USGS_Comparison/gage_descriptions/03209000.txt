This river segment follows part of the flow of the Pound River, a tributary of the Big Sandy River. The gage is located in Dickenson County, VA (Lat 37°14'13", Long 82°20'36") approximately 26 miles northeast of Norton, VA. Drainage area is 221 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1926 and is still collecting data. Flow in this area is completely regulated by the Flannagan Dam, approximately 1,700 ft upstream. There is a possibility that some water will bypass the station if the reservoir fills completely and overflows across the spillway, this water will travel down the Cane Branch and return to the Pound River 4,600 ft below the gage.
