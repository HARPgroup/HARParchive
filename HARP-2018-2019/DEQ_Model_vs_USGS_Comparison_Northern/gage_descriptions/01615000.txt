This river segment follows part of the flow of the Opequon Creek, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Clarke County (Lat. 39°10'29.0", Long. -78°04'42.0"), approximately 5.5 miles east of Winchester, VA. Drainage area is 58.2 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1943 and is still taking data. There are some diurnal fluctuations caused by mills upstream. Records from July 18, 1988 to Sept. 30, 1997 could be affected by water discharged from a treatment plant, which was diverted from another drainage basin.
