This river segment follows part of the flow of the North River, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Rockingham County (Lat. 38°20'25.5", Long. -78°54'49.1"), approximately 2 miles southeast of Mount Crawford, VA. Drainage area is 376 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1926 and is still taking data. At a point 26.8 mi upstream, there is a diversion from the Staunton Dam Reservoir. Diurnal fluctuation at low and medium flow is caused by a wastewater treatment plant discharge and irrigation at points upstream.
