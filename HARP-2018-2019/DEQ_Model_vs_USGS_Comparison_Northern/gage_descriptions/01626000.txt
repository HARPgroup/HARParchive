This river segment follows part of the flow of the South River, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Augusta County (Lat. 38°03'27.5", Long. -78°54'29.1"), approximately 0.8 mile southwest of Waynesboro, VA. Drainage area is 127 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1952 and is still taking data. At a point 13.8 mi upstream, there is a diversion from Coles Run Reservoir. There is discharge from a wastewater treatment plant upstream, originating from well fields. 41 mi upstream there is slight regulation by flood-detention reservoirs (sixteen of which were built by Soil Conservation Service between 1954 and 1961).
