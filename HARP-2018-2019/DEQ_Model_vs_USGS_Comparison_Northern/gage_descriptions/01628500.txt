This river segment follows part of the flow of the South Fork of Shenandoah River, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Rockingham County (Lat. 38°19'21.5", Long. -78°45'17.1"), approximately 5.3 miles northeast of Grottoes, VA. Drainage area is 1079 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1930 and is still taking data. Diurnal fluctuations at low flow prior to 1960 are caused by a mill at Lynnwood and since by irrigation.
