This river segment follows part of the flow of the South Fork of Shenandoah, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Warren County (Lat. 38°54'50.4", Long. -78°12'39.0"), approximately 1.6 miles southwest of Front Royal, VA. Drainage area is 1634 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1930 and is still taking data. Large diurnal fluctuations at low and medium flows are caused by powerplants upstream prior to 1954; occasional large diurnal fluctuation occurs thereafter.
