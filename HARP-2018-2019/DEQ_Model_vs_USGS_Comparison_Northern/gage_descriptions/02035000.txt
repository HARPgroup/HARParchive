This river segment follows part of the flow of the James River, a tributary of the James. The gage is located in Goochland County (Lat. 37°40'15.5", Long. -78°05'09.0"), approximately 7 miles southeast of Columbia, VA. Drainage area is 6252 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1899 and is still taking data. Moderate diurnal fluctuations are caused by powerplants upstream. Since 1982, low flows during summer months are augmented by releases from Lake Moomaw.
