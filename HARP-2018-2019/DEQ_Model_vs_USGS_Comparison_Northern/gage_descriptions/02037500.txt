This river segment follows part of the flow of the James River, a tributary of the James. The gage is located in Henrico County (Lat. 37°33'47.5", Long. -77°32'49.0"), approximately 4.5 miles northwest of Richmond, VA. Drainage area is 6753 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1934 and is still taking data. Diversions of 40 cfs to 90 cfs occur from the river downstream of the gage except during periods of low flow. Flow is regulated by powerplants upstream. Above 18.2 ft stage, there is interchange of flow with James River and Kanawha Canal. Records of daily discharge include diversions by the city of Richmond but do not include flow in the James River and Kanawha Canal (station 02037000) which diverts around this station. Since 1982, low flows during summer months are augmented by releases from Lake Moomaw.
