This river segment follows part of the flow of the Stony Creek, a tributary of the Meherrin River. The gage is located in Dinwiddie County, VA (Lat 37°04'01", Long 77°36'10") approximately 15 miles southwest of Petersburg, VA. Drainage area is 113 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1946 and is still taking data. A few times a year there is a small increase in flow due to a release from a large pond just upstream of the gage.
