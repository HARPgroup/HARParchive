This river segment follows part of the flow of the Roanoke River. The gage is located in Roanoke County, VA (Lat 37°16'04", Long 80°08'23") approximately 5 miles southwest of Salem, VA. Drainage area is 281 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1991-12-12 and is still taking data. There is frequent pumping from the river into the Spring Hollow Reservoir approximately two miles below Lafayette and seven miles upstream of Glenvar; this diversion of water is significant enough that the Glenvar gage reads lower than the Lafayette gage.
