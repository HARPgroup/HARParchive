This river segment follows part of the flow of the Roanoke River. The gage is located in Roanoke County, VA (Lat 37°15'18", Long 79°52'18") approximately 4 miles southeast of Roanoke, VA. Drainage area is 509 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1926 and is still taking data. There is complete regulation of low flow conditions in this area due to a power plant located only 200 ft upstream. There is very little storage at the facility, so excess water frequently overtops the dam.
