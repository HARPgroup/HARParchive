This river segment follows part of the flow of the Hyco River, a tributary of the Dan River. The gage is located in Halifax County, VA (Lat 36°35'16", Long 78°53'56") approximately 30 miles east of Danville, VA. Drainage area is 288 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1929 but was decommissioned in March of 2014. There is a small diurnal fluctuation caused by a gristmill approximately 15 miles upstream that will likely effect low-flow conditions. The Hyco Lake is 15.7 miles upstream which is home to the Roxboro Stream Electric Generating Plant and Afterbay Reservoir.
