This river segment follows part of the flow of the New River. The gage is located in Grayson County, VA (Lat 36°38'50", Long 80°58'45") approximately 3 miles east of Galax, VA. Drainage area is 1141 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1929 and is still taking data. There is a privately owned low concrete dam with a small generator for electricity 36.4 miles upstream of the station near the Mouth of Wilson, VA. Almost all of the water flows over the dam because it has very little storage capacity but it can cause problems for extremely low flows.
