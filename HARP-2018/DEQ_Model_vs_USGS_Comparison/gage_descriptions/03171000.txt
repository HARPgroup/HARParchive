This river segment follows part of the flow of the New River. The gage is located in Pulaski County, VA (Lat 37°08'30", Long 80°34'10") approximately 1 mile northeast of Radford, VA. Drainage area is 2767 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1907 and is still taking data. There are two dams and two power plants located in this area; the Claytor Dam, the Radford Dam, the American Electric Power Plant and the Little River Power Plant. Claytor Dam and the American Electric Power Company are located 5.5 miles upstream and regulate a majority of the normal flow that passes this gage. Radford Dam and the power plant at Little River are half a mile below Claytor Dam, which causes fluctuations during low flow periods. The Buck and Byllesyby powerplants are also in this area but are before Claytor Dam so their effect on this gage should be minimal to none at all.
