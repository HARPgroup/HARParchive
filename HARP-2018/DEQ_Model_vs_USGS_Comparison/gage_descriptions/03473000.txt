This river segment follows part of the flow of the South Fork of the Holston River, a tributary of the Tennessee River. The gage is located in Washington County, VA (Lat 36°39'06", Long 81°50'39") approximately 20 miles northeast of Bristol, VA. Drainage area is 303 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1931 and is still taking data. There may be some diurnal fluctuations during low flows due to a number of small dams upstream, as years have gone on many dams have been removed but the total number is unknown.
