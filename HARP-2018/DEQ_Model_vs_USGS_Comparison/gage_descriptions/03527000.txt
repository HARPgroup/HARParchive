This river segment follows part of the flow of the Clinch River, a tributary of the Tennessee River. The gage is located in Scott County, VA (Lat 36°38'55", Long 82°45'02") approximately 21 miles southwest of Norton, VA. Drainage area is 1123 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1920, but there is a gap from 1976-10-13 to 1978-10-02 and another between 1981-09-30 to 2001-09-17. For this reason, analysis was done from 2001-10-01 to 2005-09-30. There are no known anthropogenic alterations that would affect flow in this area.
