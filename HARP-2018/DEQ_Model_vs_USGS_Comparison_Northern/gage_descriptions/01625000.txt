This river segment follows part of the flow of the Middle River, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Augusta County (Lat. 38°15'42.5", Long. -78°51'43.1"), approximately 2 miles west  of Grottoes, VA. Drainage area is 373 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1927 and is still taking data. There are discharges of about 6.0 cfs from wastewater treatment plants upstream. Most of the water discharged from the treatment plants was diverted from another drainage basin for industrial and municipal supply. Small diurnal fluctuation at low flow is caused by upstream mills and irrigation.
