This river segment follows part of the flow of the North Fork of Shenandoah River, a tributary of the Potomac. The gage is located in Warren County (Lat. 38°58'36.4", Long. -78°20'10.0"), approximately 1.3 miles southeast of Strasburg, VA. Drainage area is 770 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1925 and is still taking data. There are large diurnal fluctuations at low and medium flows from unknown causes. Water-level elevations at the site were affected during the 1992-93 water years by construction of a new bridge about 50 ft downstream from the gage.
