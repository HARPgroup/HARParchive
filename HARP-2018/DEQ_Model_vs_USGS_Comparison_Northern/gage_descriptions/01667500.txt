This river segment follows part of the flow of the Rapidan River, a tributary of the Rappahannock. The gage is located in Culpeper County (Lat. 38°21'01.5", Long. -77°58'30.0"), approximately 8.4 miles south of Culpeper, VA. Drainage area is 468 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1930 and is still taking data. Prior to 1977, diurnal fluctuations at low flow were caused by a mill at Rapidan, and since July 1986, the flucutations have been caused by a powerplant at same site.
