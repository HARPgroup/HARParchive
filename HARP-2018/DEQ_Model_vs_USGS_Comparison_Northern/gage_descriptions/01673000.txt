This river segment follows part of the flow of the Pamunkey River, a tributary of the York. The gage is located in Hanover County (Lat. 37°46'03.5", Long. -77°19'55.9"), approximately 7.7 miles east of Ashland, VA. Drainage area is 1078 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1941 and is still taking data. There has been some regulation of flow since January 1972 by Lake Anna and occasional diurnal fluctuations at low flow are caused by an upstream mill. Unknown amounts of diversions occur for upstream irrigation.
