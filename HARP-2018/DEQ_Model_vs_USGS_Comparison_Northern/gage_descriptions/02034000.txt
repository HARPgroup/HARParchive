This river segment follows part of the flow of the Rivanna River, a tributary of the James. The gage is located in Fluvanna County (Lat. 37°51'28.5", Long. -78°15'57.0"), approximately 9 miles northwest of Columbia, VA. Drainage area is 663 sq. miles. This gage started taking data in 1934 and is still taking data. There are some diurnal fluctuations at times, mostly at low and medium flow, caused by the South Fork Rivanna River Reservoir. The diversions and discharge occur upstream at Charlottesville.
