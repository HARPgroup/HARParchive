Kyle_shiny.R

This shiny app creates a interactive dashboard where the user can input...

- what graph they want to see (between the two in watersupplyelement: either the heatmap the 2020 analysts made, 
	or Lal's critical period flow graph)
- desired run scenario id (11-18)
- desired vahydro element id
- desired vahydro PID

The output is the plot at the desired facility identified by the element id and PID 

The default facility is the Shenandoah Town Water Treatment Plant
