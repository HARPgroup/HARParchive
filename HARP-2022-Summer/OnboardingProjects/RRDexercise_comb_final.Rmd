Scope: A dam was constructed on the Roanoke River at Roanoke Rapids, NC in the early 1950s. The effects of dam and reservoir construction were analyzed using Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) parameters/metrics. 

# The IHA Flow Metrics

IHA metrics are used to describe the magnitude of monthly flows, magnitude and duration of annual extreme flows, timing of annual extreme flows, frequency of high and low pulses, and rate and frequency of flow changes (Chalise, 2021).

Flow metrics are the standards of measurement for streamflow in hydrology. Put simply, there are five categories:
~ 1. **Magnitude** - Magnitude of monthly water conditions; the mean or median value for each calendar month.
~ 2. **Duration** - Magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions; these are your annual min/max and 1,3,7,30, or 90-day means. Also includes number of zero flow days and base flow index. 
~ 3. **Timing** - Timing of annual extreme water conditions; Julian data of each annual 1-day min/max.
~ 4. **Frequency** - Frequency and duration of high and low pulses; number per water year and mean or median duration (in days) of high/low pulses. 
~ 5. **Rate** - Rate and frequency of water condition changes. Rise & fall rates: mean and median of all positive/negative differences between consecutive daily values. Number of hydrologic reversals. "


# Roanoke Rapids Dam

Roanoke Rapids Dam is located on the Roanoke River and is owned by Dominion Power Company. The dam holds back Roanoke Rapids lake, a 4,600-acre reservoir, and contains a 95-MW hydropower generation facility that powers nearly 24,000 homes (Dominion Energy). Construction of the dam was completed in 1955 and it is currently classified as “high hazard potential” under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) guidelines "by virtue of potential loss of life and extensive property damage downstream should a failure occur" (Cima and Reinicker, 2015).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"} 
knitr::include_graphics("RRdam_image.jpeg") #loading an image of the Roanoke Rapids dam
#using this method, the image must be located in the working directory of whoever is knitting and the correct name must be used in the knitr line above

## Retrieving data from the USGS

```{r, include=FALSE}
#include=FALSE causes nothing from the entire chunk to be shown in the output/knit file 
library(zoo)
library(IHA) 
library(dataRetrieval)
library(PearsonDS)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

Note: The following process for data retrieval was used in each of the parameter analyses, with variations in the variable names for the pre and post dam data. 

```{r}
#retrieve flow data for Roanoke Rapids pre and post-dam for 15 calendar year periods not including each 5 year period before and after dam construction
siteNumber <- '02080500'
startDate_pre <- '1935-01-01'
endDate_pre <- '1950-12-31'
startDate_post <- '1960-01-01'
endDate_post <- '1975-12-31'
pCode <- '00060' #the code for discharge in cfs
sCode <- '00003' #the code for daily mean data
RRflow_pre <- readNWISdv(siteNumber, pCode, startDate_pre, endDate_pre, sCode)
RRflow_post <- readNWISdv(siteNumber, pCode, startDate_post, endDate_post, sCode)
#previewing the flow data for pre and post-dam
head(RRflow_pre)
head(RRflow_post)
```

Plotting streamflow on the Roanoke River before and after dam construction:

``` {r, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 1. The Roanoke River Flow (cfs) 15 years pre and post dam construction."}
#rename the columns for both tables
colnames(RRflow_pre) <- c('Agency', 'Site No', 'Date', 'Flow', 'Code')
colnames(RRflow_post) <- c('Agency', 'Site No', 'Date', 'Flow', 'Code')
# Pre and post dam flow data from the USGS plotted
plot(1:5844, RRflow_pre$Flow, xlab='Date', ylab='Flow (cfs)',type = 'l', col = 'blue', ylim = c(0, 250000))
lines(RRflow_post$Flow, xlab='Date', ylab='Flow (cfs)',type = 'l', col = 'red', ylim = c(0, 250000))
title(main = "The Roanoke River Flow Pre and Post Dam")
legend(x= 4500 ,y= 230000 ,legend=c("Pre dam","Post dam"), col=c('blue','red'), bty='n',lty=1)
```

# PARAMETER 1: MAGNITUDE OF MONTHLY WATER CONDITIONS

- The magnitude of flow for each calendar month is represented by either the mean or median discharge over any given month 
-  Monthly magnitudes are computed by the “group1” function in the IHA package which produces a 12-column table, one for each month, and rows for each year of record in the data series used 
- Mean and median are both measures of central tendency and are specified in the function. Large differences between the two indicate outliers
- Both mean and median representations of magnitude are explored in this analysis for comparison 



```{r}
#making the flow data objects into zoo objects for use in IHA package 
RRpre_z <- zoo(RRflow_pre$Flow, order.by=RRflow_pre$Date)
RRpost_z <- zoo(RRflow_post$Flow, order.by=RRflow_post$Date)
#using group1() IHA function for monthly magnitude (both mean and median)
Monthly_pre_mean <- as.data.frame(group1(RRpre_z, year = 'calendar', FUN = mean)) #calendar year was chosen here in order to avoid having null values for any months since we retrieved the data according to calendar years not water years 
Monthly_post_mean <- as.data.frame(group1(RRpost_z, year = 'calendar', FUN = mean))
Monthly_pre_med <- as.data.frame(group1(RRpre_z, year = 'calendar', FUN = median))
Monthly_post_med <- as.data.frame(group1(RRpost_z, year = 'calendar', FUN = median))
head(Monthly_pre_mean) #previewing one of the resulting tables for monthly magnitude 
```

<br>

Plotting monthly magnitudes (mean) as box plots:

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Boxplots showing the values for monthly magnitude (mean) pre and post-dam."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #creates 2 windows side-by-side for the plots to be shown
boxplot(Monthly_pre_mean, ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'Monthly mean pre-dam')
boxplot(Monthly_post_mean, ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'Monthly mean post-dam')
```

<br>

Creating tables using median instead of mean to represent magnitude:

```{r}
#using the group1() IHA function again for monthly magnitude
Monthly_pre_med <- as.data.frame(group1(RRpre_z, year = 'calendar', FUN = median))
Monthly_post_med <- as.data.frame(group1(RRpost_z, year = 'calendar', FUN = median))
```

Plotting monthly magnitudes (median) as box plots:

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Boxplots showing the values for monthly magnitude (median) pre and post-dam."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(Monthly_pre_med,  ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'Monthly median pre-dam')
boxplot(Monthly_post_med, ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'Monthly median post-dam')
```

<br>

Plotting the changes in the monthly magnitude (mean) for the month of January:

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 4. Change in monthly magnitude (mean) for January caused by dam construction."}
#creating vectors containing years under analysis for plot labeling purposes
years1 <- as.vector(c('1935', '1936', '1937', '1938', '1939', '1940', '1941', '1942', '1943', '1944', '1945', '1946', '1947', '1948', '1949', '1950'))
years2 <- as.vector(c('1960', '1961', '1962', '1963', '1964', '1965', '1966', '1967', '1968', '1969', '1970', '1971', '1972', '1973', '1974', '1975'))
#plotting change in monthly magnitude (mean) for January before and after dam construction 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Monthly_pre_mean$January, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'January mean flows pre-dam', type = 'l', col = 'red', axes = FALSE)
axis(1, 0:15, labels = years1)
axis(2)
plot(Monthly_post_mean$January, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'January mean flows post-dam', type = 'l', col = 'blue', axes = FALSE)
axis(1, 0:15, labels = years2)
axis(2)
```

<br>

Plotting the changes in the monthly magnitude (median) for the month of January:

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 5. Change in monthly magnitude (median) for January caused by dam construction."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Monthly_pre_med$January, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'January median flows pre-dam', type = 'l', col = 'red', axes = FALSE)
axis(1, 0:15, labels = years1)
axis(2)
plot(Monthly_post_med$January, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(1000,40000), main = 'January median flows post-dam', type = 'l', col = 'blue', axes = FALSE)
axis(1, 0:15, labels = years2)
axis(2)
```

<br>

Examining how the dam influenced the magnitude of January flows, which is usually a month of higher flows compared to the rest of the year:

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 6. Changes in monthly magnitude for January caused by dam construction."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Monthly_pre_mean$January, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(0,40000), main = 'January mean flows', type = 'l', col = 'red')
lines(Monthly_post_mean$January, type = 'l', col = 'blue')
legend("topright", legend=c("Pre-dam", "Post-dam"), col= c("red", "blue"), lwd=1)
plot(Monthly_pre_med$January, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Monthly magnitude (cfs)', ylim = c(0,40000), main = 'January median flows', type = 'l', col = 'red')
lines(Monthly_post_med$January, type = 'l', col = 'blue')
legend("topright", legend=c("Pre-dam", "Post-dam"), col= c("red", "blue"), lwd=1)
```

<br>

Now, examining how the dam influenced the magnitude of August flows, which is usually a month of lower flows compared to the rest of the year:

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 7. Changes in monthly magnitude for August caused by dam construction."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Monthly_pre_mean$August, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Flow (cfs)', ylim = c(0,40000), main = 'August mean flows', type = 'l', col = 'red')
lines(Monthly_post_mean$August, type = 'l', col = 'blue')
legend("topright", legend=c("Pre-dam", "Post-dam"), col= c("red", "blue"), lwd=1)
plot(Monthly_pre_med$August, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Flow (cfs)', ylim = c(0,40000), main = 'August median flows', type = 'l', col = 'red')
lines(Monthly_post_med$August, type = 'l', col = 'blue')
legend("topright", legend=c("Pre-dam", "Post-dam"), col= c("red", "blue"), lwd=1)
```

<br>

These graphs for August show a similar change in monthly magnitude to that of January: the range of magnitudes was decreased and the peaks were shaved off.


## Conclusions on Parameter 1:

- The construction of the dam and reservoir contributed to more consistent monthly magnitudes and less significant changes in average monthly flows 
- The observed change in monthly magnitude appeared to be more significant in low-flow months, such as August
- The monthly magnitude as an average was stabilized by dam construction. 
- The change in monthly magnitude caused by the dam appears greater when mean is used to represent magnitude.

- The function "group2" results in a table with 13 variables: Year, 1 Day Min/Max, 3 Day Min/Max, 7 Day Min/Max, 30 Day Min/Max, 90 Day Min/Max, Zero Flow Days, and Base index.
- The minimum and maximum values reflect the average extreme flow conditions over the course of the specific duration. They are taken from moving averages for every possible period that is completely within the water year
- Zero Flow Days can mostly be ignored in data analysis in our case, since there are no days when the Roanoke River dried completely.
- The Base Flow Index (BFI) represents the measure of the proportion of the river that derives from 
stored sources, like groundwater. A higher BFI signifies a more sustained flow during dry weather (NRFA, 2022).

## Conclusion on Parameter 2:

Post dam:
- The average minimum flow events vary less over longer periods of time
- The average maximum flow events become substantially more stable
- The effects of extreme short term weather events are mitigated
- The base flow becomes more stable

The effects these changes in the flow have on the environment are, for example (IHA, 2009):

- Competition between native and invasive organisms
- Disturbances in the structures of aquatic ecosystems
- Changes in the river channel morphology
- Changes in the volume of nutrient exchange

# PARAMETER 3: TIMING OF ANNUAL EXTREME WATER CONDITIONS

- The Julian date of each annual 1-day maximum or minimum flow 
- Julian date here is considered the number day of each year from 1-365. January 1st is day 1 and December 31st is day 365. 
- This parameter provides a look at what time of year the extremes may be occurring.

- Dates of the minimum flows post-dam all appear to occur at the very ends or beginnings of the years. This would mean that the *minimum* flows were occurring in the winter months, which is peculiar. (see figure 19)

# PARAMETER 4: FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF HIGH AND LOW PULSES

- The function “group4” creates a table showing the number of low and high pulses within in each water year and the average duration each pulse lasted (days)
- A pulse is the daily mean streamflow above or below certain thresholds. A high pulse is considered a daily streamflow above the 75th percentile, while a low pulse is considered a daily streamflow below the 25th percentile. 
- The pulse thresholds are found using the shortened water years only. If a period of days in a pulse impacts two water years, they are only counted in the first water year. 
- The length of pulses is the mean number of days the pulses lasted in that year.

## Conclusions on Parameter 4:

Low Pulses:
- There were a lot more low pulses post dam than pre dam. This means the mean streamflow post-dam went below the 25th percentile a lot more often than the streamflow pre-dam. 
- We can also conclude the low pulses lasted longer pre dam than post dam. The average amount of days the low pulse lasted pre-dam was 5.32 days where the average amount of days the low pulse lasted post-dam was 1.82.

High Pulses:
- High pulses did not differ dramatically. High pulses stayed consistent pre-dam. 
- Post dam it dropped in 1966, could be due to drought which lasted from 1962-1971. The peak in 1972 was due to a large flood on June 21-24 (USGS 2022). 

The effects these changes in the flow have on the environment are, for example (IHA, 2009):

- Frequency and magnitude of soil
moisture stress for plants
- Frequency and duration of anaerobic
stress for plants
- Availability of floodplain habitats for
aquatic organisms
- Nutrient and organic matter
exchanges between river and
floodplain

# PARAMETER 5: RATE AND FREQUENCY OF WATER CONDITION CHANGES

- Rate and frequency of water condition changes: how drastically and how often flow rates rise or fall. 
- Rise Rates: Mean or Median of all positive differences between consecutive daily values. 
- Fall Rates: Mean or Median of all negative differences between consecutive daily values.
- Hydrologic Reversal: When the flow rate changes from falling to rising and vice versa.

## Conclusions on Parameter 5:
- Fall rates post-dam appear to be greater and more variable than pre-dam fall rates. This could be due to large-scale removal of water from the dam reservoir for agricultural or industrial use. 
- There were more hydrologic reversals after implementing the dam. This could be because the dam allows people to change and control the stream flow of the river.
