**2040 Water Supply Demand Scenario**
Projected Water Use: The following section discusses projected water use through 2040 within the
Middle James Minor Basin, based on projections provided in local and regional water supply plans. Table
36, included in the existing demand section above, is the basis for information discussed in this section.
Total demand within the basin is projected to increase from 163.09 MGD in 2020 to 218.83 MGD in 2040, or
34.1% overall. Surface water demand is projected to increase by 50.1 MGD, or 33.90%, by 2040. Groundwater
demand is projected to increase by 5.64 MGD, or 36.89%, by 2040. Surface water is projected to comprise
90% of total demand in the basin by 2040 and also constitutes the majority of the projected demand increase.
The largest contributors to this increase in total projected demand comes from demand increases for the
City of Richmond’s WTP, Henrico County’s WTP, and Lynchburg’s Pedlar Reservoir.

Demand from CWS users within the basin is projected to increase by 36% by 2040. Within this category,
surface water use is projected to increase by 35.77%, while groundwater use is projected to increase by 100%.
However, by volume the projected groundwater demand increase for CWS users is only 0.53 MGD.
Demand from Large SSUs within the basin is projected to increase by 29.57% in total demand by 2040.
Within this category, surface water use is projected to increase by 28.66%, while groundwater use is projected
to increase by 104.04%. However, by volume the projected groundwater demand increase for Large SSUs is
only 0.33 MGD while surface water is 7.47 MGD. Major contributors to increased demand for Large SSUs
include the Georgia-Pacific Big Island WTP, the Riverville Mill WTP, and locality estimates for Large SSU
increases in the City of Lynchburg and Powhatan County.

Demand from Small SSUs within the basin is projected to increase by 34.33% by 2040. As noted previously,
Small SSU demand is entirely met with groundwater. Increased Small SSU demand is largely driven by
increasing demands in Goochland, Fluvanna, Albemarle, and Powhatan counties, among others. These
demands align closely with increasing population projections in the basin.

Demand from Agriculture Users within the basin is not projected to change significantly by 2040 for either
surface water or groundwater. As populations expand, loss of agricultural lands occur. As a result water
demands for agricultural use is projected to remain constant over the planning period.
