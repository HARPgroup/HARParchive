**2040 Water Supply Demand Scenario (SAMPLE DATA ONLY)**

The total existing demand from all surface and groundwater sources is approximately 46.43 MGD, with
groundwater supplying approximately 29.65 MGD or 63% of total water demands. Surface water demand
within the basin totals approximately 16.79 MGD, or 37% of current demands. Groundwater supplies the
majority of demands in the Meherrin Nottoway Minor Basin, as most of the basin is able to make use of the
high capacity and high quality Coastal Plain Aquifer system.
The five largest facility demands for each source type are provided in Table 47. The largest groundwater
demands include International Paper’s Franklin Mill, which currently represents approximately 14.31 MGD,
or 48% of current groundwater demand in the basin. The Solenis Chemical Plant and several smaller
Community Water System (CWS) facilities represent the remaining top 5 groundwater users. The largest
surface water users include the City of Chesapeake’s Northwest River/Western Branch System, Greensville
County’s Jarrat WTP, and the International Paper Company Franklin Mill. Surface water is the primary
water source for the largest CWS facilities, while groundwater primarily supplies Large Self-Supplied Users
(Large SSUs).
