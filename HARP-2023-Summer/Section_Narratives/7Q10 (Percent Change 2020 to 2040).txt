The 7Q10 statistic describes a 7 day low flow condition that is expected to occur only one time in a 10-year period. Because decreases to instream flows can reduce the waste assimilative capacity of a stream, 7Q10 is a common flow metric used to establish point source discharge limits, is used to assess potential risk to assimilative capacity from water supply system changes. By pointing out areas that are projected to see decreases in 7Q10 by 2040, this analysis will enable stakeholders to avert unforeseen conflicts between withdrawals and discharges.
