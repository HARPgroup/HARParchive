"90 day low flow" is a long-term drought metric, and is the lowest 90 day flow simulated in the modeling time period. 90 day lowest flow is almost invariably the result of an extremely dry winter, followed by a summer with low to moderate rainfall and high temperatures. 90 day low flows can be a useful indicator for evaluating vulnerability to a prolonged drought for reservoir planning purposes.
