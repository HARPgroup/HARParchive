This map and table compares long term drought under current conditions (2020 modeled scenario) against a future dry climate change scenario. The Dry Climate scenario was developed to model cumulative impacts under future climate change conditions. The primary inputs are estimates of 2040 future water demands using projections submitted through local and regional water supply plans, combined with future climate change meteorological conditions that are considered "Dry" based on total precipitation and evaporation changes.
