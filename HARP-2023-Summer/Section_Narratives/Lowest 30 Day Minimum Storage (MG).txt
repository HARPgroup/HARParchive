Water availability in each river segment is a cumulative display of availability in the river segment shown, plus availability upstream, including available storage within the river segment and upstream. Upstream river segments may be outside the region boundary, and not displayed on the map. Additional water use upstream would decrease the availability downstream. Therefore, water availability can be used for planning purposes, but DOES NOT mean that the net available water in the river segments shown are available directly to the users withdrawing from that river segment.
