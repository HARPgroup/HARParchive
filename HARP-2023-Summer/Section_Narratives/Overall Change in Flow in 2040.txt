Overall change in flow (consumptive use) describes the net loss of water from the riverine system that is not returned through point source discharges. This metric represents the ratio of long term average modeled flow for a particular model scenario, compared to long term average baseline flow. In essence, watershed level consumptive use describes the overall change in flow expected for a particular model scenario. This can help describe potential impacts to downstream withdrawals, while also providing a basis for evaluating impacts to aquatic life. The results displayed are an annual average, and can underestimate impacts during peak use.

**Notes:**

 * The Percent Change in Flow column in the table below indicates consumptive use where the percentage value is negative, and flow augmentation (due to change in meteorology, releases, groundwater intersection, etc.) where the percentage value is positive.
